This repository contains the web-site application for the <b>Railway Station</b>. It was developed as a project for the Software Engineering course.</br></br>

Front-end of this application was written using JQuery, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Back-end part of this application was developed using plain Java and JAX-RS services. Our team also has written a connection between the back-end and relational DBMS in order to keep track of all the data needed for the railway station. The database we have used is MySQL workbench. Both front-end and back-end was written using the Eclipse environment.</br></br>
